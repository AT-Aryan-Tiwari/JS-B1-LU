    // This statement prints 122, as JS is not type bound, meaning that type of 1 is changed to string,
    // giving us the output

    // console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");
    // In this case, 1++"2" takes the numeric type into consideration, as ++ forces JS to do numeric
    // addition. This gives out the result as 3 (a numeric value). When 3+"2" is performed, 32 is received
    // as the output, as JS is not type bound, leading to string concatenation.
    
    // console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
    // In this case, 1+-"1" takes the numeric type into consideration, as +- forces JS to do numeric
    // subtraction. This gives out the result as 0 (a numeric value). When 0+"2" is performed, 
    // 02 is received as the output, as JS is not type bound, leading to string concatenation.
    
    // console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");
    // Basic string concatenation performed, giving 112 as output.

    // console.log( "A" - "B" + "2");
    //"A"-"B" is operation between string, giving NaN (undefined Not-a-number value) as output.
    // When NaN encounters +"2", string concatenation takes place (as JS is not type bound), 
    // leading to the final output being NaN2.

    // console.log( "A" - "B" + 2);
    //"A"-"B" is operation between string, giving NaN (undefined Not-a-number value) as output.
    // When NaN encounters +2, an undefined output is received, hence the output is NaN.
